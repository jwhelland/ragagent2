# Mars Exploration Missions

NASA has a long history of exploring the Red Planet through a variety of orbiters, landers, and rovers.

## Perseverance Rover

The **Perseverance** rover, nicknamed *Percy*, is a car-sized Mars rover designed to explore the crater Jezero on Mars as part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission. It was manufactured by **JPL** and launched on July 30, 2020. Perseverance carries seven primary scientific instruments, including the **Mastcam-Z** and **SuperCam**.

## Curiosity Rover

**Curiosity** is another car-sized rover that has been exploring Gale Crater on Mars since August 6, 2012. It was also developed by **JPL**. Its primary mission is to investigate the Martian climate and geology, and to assess whether Gale Crater has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life.

## Scientific Goals

Both rovers aim to search for signs of ancient life and collect samples for future return to Earth. They operate under the management of **JPL**, which is a division of **Caltech**.
