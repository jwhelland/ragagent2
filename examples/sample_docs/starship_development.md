# SpaceX Starship Development

The **Starship** is a fully reusable super heavy-lift launch vehicle being developed by **SpaceX**. It is designed to carry both crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, **Mars**, and beyond.

## Architecture

Starship consists of two main stages:
1. **Super Heavy**: The first-stage booster, powered by **Raptor** engines.
2. **Starship**: The second-stage spacecraft, which also serves as a long-duration cargo and passenger spacecraft.

## Mission to Mars

**Elon Musk**, the founder of **SpaceX**, has stated that the ultimate goal of Starship is to enable the colonization of **Mars**. SpaceX plans to use Starship to transport large numbers of people and tons of cargo to the Martian surface to build a self-sustaining city.

## Testing at Boca Chica

Testing and development of the Starship prototypes take place at **Starbase**, the SpaceX facility in Boca Chica, Texas. Several successful high-altitude flight tests have been conducted, demonstrating the vehicle's unique "belly flop" landing maneuver.
