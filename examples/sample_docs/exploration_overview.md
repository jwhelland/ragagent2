* **NASA** (National Aeronautics and Space Administration): The United States government agency responsible for the civilian space program.
* **SpaceX**: A private American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company founded by **Elon Musk**.
* **JPL** (Jet Propulsion Laboratory): A federally funded research and development center and NASA field center in La Cañada Flintridge, California.
